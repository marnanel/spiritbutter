  <sb:body><p>So many years have passed since first you sought<br></br>the lands beyond the edges of the sky,<br></br>
so many moons reflected in your eye,<br></br>
(familiar newness, fear of leaving port),<br></br>
since first you sought, and failed, and learned to fall,<br></br>
(first hope, then cynicism, silent dread,<br></br>
the countless stars, still counting overhead<br></br>
the seconds to your final voyage of all...)<br></br>
and last, in glory gold and red around<br></br>
your greatest search, your final quest to know!<br></br>
yet... ashes drift, the embers cease to glow,<br></br>
and darkened life in frozen death is drowned;<br></br>
and ashes on the swell are seen no more.<br></br>
The silence surges. <b>Error 404</b>.</p>'
